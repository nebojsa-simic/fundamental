# Contributing to Fundamental

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) - All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/.../fundamental/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/.../fundamental/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Bug Reports** should have:

- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What actually happened
- What you expected should happen
- Notes: (why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work, or a workaround)

We *love* bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Please use `clang-format` for consistency

## License
